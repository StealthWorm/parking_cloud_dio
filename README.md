# PARKING PROJECT DIGITAL INNOVATION ONE - DIO

</div>

> Project for Java Studies

In this project I had the challenge of developing a set of APIs using **Spring Boot** to control a parking lot. The entry, exit and amount to be charged from the customer will be controlled. All API development best practices were applied, including security with **Spring Security** and access to **PostgreSQL** databases. Tests and test coverage reports were performed. After completion, the app was deployed to the Heroku cloud in order to make our API available to the Internet.
